/**
 * <p>
 * A mathematical program (MP), more precisely a linear program or a mixed
 * integer linear program, consisting of variables (with bounds), constraints,
 * and an objective. Such a mathematical program defines a set of feasible
 * solutions. A candidate solution is an association of a value to each of the
 * variables of the program, the value being within the bounded domain of the
 * variable (see {@link Variable}). A feasible solution is a candidate solution
 * that satisfies all the constraints in the program. This object may represent
 * programs that are infeasible, meaning that they have no feasible solutions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A feasible solution is optimal iff it has the best value according to its
 * objective function (best meaning an objective function value higher than or
 * equal to the objective function value of any other feasible solution, for a
 * maximization sense, or a value lower than or equal to, for a minimization
 * sense). An MP (as representable by this object) has no optimal solutions iff
 * it has no feasible solution or it is unbounded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An MP may have the {@link Objective#ZERO ZERO} objective, which indicates
 * that it does not care about optimizing anything, only about finding a
 * feasible solution. For an MP with the <code>ZERO</code> objective, all
 * feasible solutions are optimal.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Two MPs are considered equal when they define the same (as per
 * {@link #equals}) name, variables, constraints, and objective. Two equal MPs,
 * as determined by this interface {@link #equals(Object)} contract, have the
 * same set of feasible solutions, although a non equality between two MPs does
 * <em>not</em> imply that they have different sets of feasible solutions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface may be writeable, immutable or be a
 * read-only view.
 * </p>
