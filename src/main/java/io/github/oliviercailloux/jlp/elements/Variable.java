/**
 * <p>
 * An object which may be used to refer to a variable in a linear programming
 * context. A variable in a linear program often refers to other objects from
 * some set. Consider for example the set of variables x_i with i being taken
 * from some set I. The index i may refer to a product, and x refer to the cost
 * of that product. In such a case the variable name would be "x", and the
 * reference object would be a product.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A variable has a description. The description should be unique to that
 * variable (in objects in which the variable will appear). It is suggested to
 * make it a short description, for example, "c_p1" for a variable representing
 * the cost of the product number 1.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A variable {@link #equals(Object)} an other one when both descriptions are
 * equal and they have the same bounds and domain.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is expected that this object be immutable. In particular, it is important
 * that the description does not change once a variable has been added to a
 * constraint, or a problem. (This is because hashcode, or equality status viz
 * other variables, should not change, and because it will also be referred to
 * in solutions of problems.) Hence, the bounds and domain of this variable
 * should be considered as a structural property of the variable, meaning, a
 * property that will never change.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A variable has a domain (integer or real), and bounds which may further
 * restrict its domain. We call this its bounded domain. For example, an integer
 * variable with a lower bound of -3.1 and upper bound of 0.8 has as bounded
 * domain {-3, -2, -1, 0}, the integers between -3 and 0. The bounds can be set
 * freely, as long as they are finite numbers and that it leaves at least one
 * finite number within the bounds. Thus, the lower bound must be lower than or
 * equal to the upper bound, and, in the case of integers, the range defined by
 * the bounds must contain an integer (for example lower bound 3.2 and upper
 * bound 3.3 is forbidden).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Supplementary to its domain, this library further partitions the variables
 * into three kinds of variable. A variable is of kind
 * {@link VariableKind#BOOL_KIND} iff its domain is the integers and its bounds
 * are exactly zero and one. A variable is of kind {@link VariableKind#INT_KIND}
 * iff its domain is the integers and its bounds are anything else than [0, 1].
 * A variable is of kind {@link VariableKind#REAL_KIND} iff its domain is real.
 * It follows that boolean variables have a bounded domain equal to {0, 1}, but
 * the converse does not hold: a variable of kind integer with bounds [-0.5,
 * 1.5] also has a {0, 1} bounded domain.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Assume you want a variable to refer to a Truck in your domain model, but
 * truck has an inappropriately long toString description. Then you can subclass
 * this class and create a TruckVariable class, with a reference to a Truck, and
 * an overridden {@link #getDescription()}. If this class is inherited, the
 * inheriting class must honor the contracts of this class (objects of this
 * library count on it), except that it may provide a different description (as
 * implementation of {@link #toString()}), subject to the constraints in this
 * documentation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Rationale for the uniqueness constraint of the description: this makes it
 * possible for the user to retrieve the variable knowing only its description,
 * given a problem. We could also have made equality depend on its name and
 * references, to make it possible to retrieve the variable knowing its name and
 * references. But this has no advantage: we would then have to mandate as
 * especially important that the references do not change and identify uniquely
 * the variable, in which case it is anyway probably easy to provide a unique
 * string description; and furthermore the user would have to hold a reference
 * equal to the original reference in order to retrieve the variable, not just a
 * description of it. In any case, ensuring uniqueness of the description is a
 * good idea to make the MP contents clear, and provides for a cleaner interface
 * and concept. Furthermore, the user may with the adopted solution refer to
 * mutable objects, provided that the description itself does not change. And it
 * is probably easier for the user to retrieve the description from the variable
 * name and references than the converse. Finally, we could also rely on default
 * equality implementation (equality as identity), but this would result in two
 * variables being created with Variable.int("x") as being confusingly treated
 * as different variables, and would provide an advantage only if the user does
 * not use descriptions (e.g. uses only empty names and descriptions), which
 * renders any printing of the problem unreadable.
 * </p>
