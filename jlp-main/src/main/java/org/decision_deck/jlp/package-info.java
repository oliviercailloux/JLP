/**
 * <p>The root package of this library.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Many classes of this library have a type parameter, designated by the letter V, indicating 
 * the type you want to use for the variables of the program. Informations about what type should 
 * be used there is available in the documentation of the {@link org.decision_deck.jlp.problem.LpProblem} class.</p>
 * <p>Important technical terms used by this library (linear program, feasible solution, etc.) are defined in the {@link org.decision_deck.jlp.problem.LpProblem} documentation.</p>
 * <p>For a quick start: create a new problem using {@link org.decision_deck.jlp.problem.LpProblems}, define your linear program using the resulting {@link org.decision_deck.jlp.problem.LpProblem} interface, obtain a solver using {@link org.decision_deck.jlp.instanciation.LpSolverFactory}, and solve it using the resulting {@link org.decision_deck.jlp.LpSolver} instance.</p> 
 * <p>TODO Add javadoc comments for all packages and public methods (enable relevant compiler warning).</p>
