/**
 * <p>
 * A solver instance, representing a problem (with data, constraints), a set of
 * parameters for solving the problem, and possibly after having been run, a
 * feasible solution. The solver abstracts several commercial and free solvers
 * such as lp_solve, CPLEX, etc., and thus relies on a solver implementation
 * called the underlying solver.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The solver may be run several times. It remembers its bound problem and
 * parameters between runs. Elements may be changed in between runs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The solver also offers a possiblity for the user to mess manually with the
 * underlying solver, that can be used to access advanced functionalities not
 * offered by the wrapper (but please consider rather adding the functionality
 * to the wrapper itself if it makes sense, or introduce a bug report to that
 * effect). However, this possibility must be used with caution. After the
 * underlying solver is retrieved by the user, this solver does not update its
 * content any more (to avoid erasing manually introduced changes). Hence,
 * calling {@link #getUnderlyingSolver()} then modifying the bound problem is
 * forbidden. Although this is currently not enforced, the user
 * <em>should not</em> modify this solver state through the parameters or the
 * problem views after a call to {@link #getUnderlyingSolver()}. The caller must
 * not forget to {@link #close()} the solver after use when using it manually,
 * except that the methods {@link #solve()} and {@link #writeProblem} close the
 * underlying solver after the job is done, thus it is not necessary to call
 * close again after these calls. After a call to {@link #solve()} or
 * {@link #writeProblem}, the underlying solver pointer is not valid any more.
 *
 * TODO make {@link #getUnderlyingSolver()} bring this object to an immutable
 * state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a problem is transferred to the underlying solver by this solver, the
 * variables having a type of {@link LpVariableType#BOOL} are associated with 0
 * and 1 lower and upper bounds except if their associated bounds are even
 * further constrained. E.g. a variable defined as BOOL with bounds of <0.5, 4>
 * have its bounds modified to become <0.5, 1> for the underlying solver.
 * However this object will report the bounds as they are set in the problem,
 * thus with bounds of <0.5, 4>. Also note that this solver does not attempt to
 * transform the input in a manner dependent on the underlying solver. If, for
 * example, a 0-1 binary solver is used, the bounds are <em>not</em>
 * automatically transformed to conform to this setting. (Thus in that situation
 * the solver will throw an exception when attempted to solve.) An undefined
 * bound is equivalent to a minus, or plus, infinity. This is so, once again,
 * independently of the underlying solver. This permits to ensure that the same
 * problem is solved independently of the chosen underlying solver. An automatic
 * transformation is done in cases it does not modify the problem, e.g. if the
 * underlying solver requires integer bounds for integer variables, the bounds
 * will be set accordingly (e.g. transforming a lower bound of 2.5 to a
 * lowerbound of 3) because this has no impact on the set of feasible solution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The type of the objects used for the variables should have their
 * {@link #equals(Object)} method implemented in a meaningful way as this is
 * used when retrieving the values, and their {@link #hashCode()} method should
 * be correctly implemented. The variables should be immutable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified in the documentation of specific solvers, the
 * solution returned by {@link #getSolution()} is set with the exact values
 * returned by the solver, i.e. no attempt is made to be clever and change the
 * returned solution values. E.g. if the optimal value is not returned by the
 * underlying solver, it is not set in the solution, although it could possibly
 * be deduced from the variable values and the objective function. Also no
 * attempt is made to round supposedly integer results. This allows the user to
 * manually take into account the numerical imprecision of the solver used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note about unconstrained variable: it is admitted to include variables that
 * are used in no constraints and no objective function in a problem. Such a
 * variable may have bounds. This solver does not take action: if the underlying
 * solver gives a solution involving these variables (therefore chosen
 * arbitrarily), it will appear as a solution. Forcing, with this solver, no
 * solution for such a variable would be appropriate only if the variable has no
 * bound. If it has, then a solution should be given to avoid exhibiting a
 * different behavior between a bound on a variable and a constraint expressing
 * the same bound.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Problems may be solved without an objective function, in which case the solve
 * will simply search for a feasible solution. In this case it never returns the
 * status {@link LpResultStatus#OPTIMAL}. When solve is called, the bound
 * problem must have its objective function defined iff the objective direction
 * is defined. Defining one and not the other one is meaningless and considered
 * as an error.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Solving a problem with no constraints (and even no variables) is allowed and
 * results in a {@link LpResultStatus#FEASIBLE} status if no objective function
 * is given.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that solvers may give a solution that is slightly outside the defined
 * bounds for the variable.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <V>
 *            the type of the variables.
